-- Approach: The signal function is sampled as frequently as possible. It's
-- the OS's task to allocate resources, so we can just as well use up all the
-- CPU cycles we get. But since drawing is very time consuming, we draw at a
-- fixed, user-defineable, presumably lower rate, thus allowing the user to
-- control the ratio between the cycles spent on drawing and the cycles spent
-- on editing/simulation. This approach may result in rather uneven sampling
-- intervals, but embedSynch can be used to provide a stable time base when
-- that is important, e.g. for simulation, as long as there are enough cycles
-- on average to keep up.
--
-- For some reason, context switching does not work as it should unless
-- the window tick mechanism is enabled. For that reason, we use a high
-- frequency tick (1kHz). (Alternatively, passing the -C runtime flag (e.g.
-- +RTS -C1) forces regular context switches. Moreover, getting events
-- without delay seems to require yielding to ensure that the thread
-- receiving them gets a chance to run. This can be done using yield prior to
-- galling HGL.maybeGetWindowEvent. Alternatively, we can get the window tick,
-- and since the tick frequency is high, no major waiting should ensue. This
-- is the current method, although it seems as if this method means that
-- window close events often will be missed.

-- Animation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Animate a signal function
-- fr ......... Frame rate.
-- title ...... Window title.
-- width ...... Window width in pixels.
-- height ..... Window height in pixels.
-- render ..... Renderer; invoked at the frame rate.
-- tco ........ Text Console Output; invoked at every step.
-- sf ......... Signal function to animate.

-- !!! Note: it would be easy to add an argument (a -> IO b) as well, allowing
-- !!! arbitrary I/O. One could even replace the text output by such a
-- !!! function. Could one possibly somehow get data back into the signal
-- !!! function by means of continuations? Or maybe the IOTask monad is the
-- !!! way to go, with a special "reactimateIOTask".
