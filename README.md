# SpaceInvaders

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivanperez-keera/SpaceInvaders.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ivanperez-keera/SpaceInvaders)
[![Version on Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/SpaceInvaders.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/SpaceInvaders)

This is a Haskell Space Invaders game implemented using the Functional
Reactive Programming library Yampa.

The game has been created for educational purposes, but tries to feature a
substantial amount of the complexity often found in real arcade games. For example,
differentiated subsystems for physics/collisions, input, rendering/multimedia, logic, etc.

## Installation

The game is available on [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/SpaceInvaders) and you can install it with*:

```
$ cabal update
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install SpaceInvaders
$ ./.cabal-sandbox/bin/spaceInvaders
```

If you want to explore the code and possibly make changes, do the following:

```
$ cabal update
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal unpack SpaceInvaders        # or git clone https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/SpaceInvaders.git
$ cd SpaceInvaders-*                # Game resources are here
$ cabal install
$ ./dist/build/spaceInvaders/spaceInvaders
```

*__Additional notes__:
For the use of the above installation instructions you need [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) and the [command-line interface for cabal](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/tree/master/cabal-install). On debian/ubuntu, you can install them with:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ghc cabal-install
```

## Documentation

To try and make things as clear as possible, the code includes a much haddock
documentation and comments as we could reasonably fit. You can compile those with:

```
$ cabal unpack SpaceInvaders     ## Or git clone this-repo
$ cd SpaceInvaders-*
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install --only-dependencies
$ cabal configure && cabal haddock --executables --internal
```

## Educators

If you find this game attractive and would like to use it to teach functional
programming or other subjects, we'd be very happy to know about it. We can
provide extra material that you can show to students (videos, screenshots,
etc.).

## Help and collaboration

You can collaborate at least in two ways:

* File an [issue](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/SpaceInvaders/issues).
* Write documentation (send a link and/or a pull request).

We would like to call on Haskell programmers, game developers and anyone with an interest in Functional Reactive Programming and/or Game Programming to review the code, ask for clarification when it is not clear enough, and help us improve the game, and the state of FRP/Yampa programming as well.
